    "    <li>[Write this up in document once figured out] Looking at the first few rows for the \"tags\" dataset, it looks like I'll need to create different subsets of tags. The ones that show up in the first few rows are media types, but there are also tags for specific works, character pairings, and thematic tags. Bare minimum, breaking these down into subsets would give us more flexibility as we start to work through everything.</li>\n",

    "            <li>What do the trends look like for different-sex pairings versus same-sex pairings? Is there any way to examine that with the data we have on hand? I suspect that this could be done for a single fandom, but not for the entire dataset. If I'm understanding the task correctly, you'd have to go through and use a lookup table (or something) to identify the gender of each character.</li>\n",

Does this tend to happen for different-sex pairings at the same rate as same-sex pairings? When it does happen, is gender-bending typically limited to romantic pairings, or are other characters also gender-bent despite not being involved in the main investments of the plot?</li>\n",
